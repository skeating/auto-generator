In addition, SBML documents using a given package must indicate whether
understanding the package is required for complete mathematical
interpretation of a model, or whether the package is optional.  This is
done using the attribute \token{required} on the \token{<sbml>} element
in the SBML document.  For the PACKAGENAME the value of the required attribute is \val{false}.
