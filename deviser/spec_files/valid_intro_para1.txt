This section summarizes all the conditions that must (or in some cases,
at least \emph{should}) be true of an SBML Level~LEVELNUM Version~VERSIONNUM model that
uses the PACKAGENAME. We use the same conventions as are used in the
SBML Level~LEVELNUM Version~VERSIONNUM Core specification document. In particular, there
are different degrees of rule strictness. Formally, the differences are
expressed in the statement of a rule: either a rule states that a
condition \emph{must} be true, or a rule states that it \emph{should} be
true. Rules of the former kind are strict SBML validation rules---a
model encoded in SBML must conform to all of them in order to be
considered valid. Rules of the latter kind are consistency rules. To
help highlight these differences, we use the following three symbols
next to the rule numbers:
