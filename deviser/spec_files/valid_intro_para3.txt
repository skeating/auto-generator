\item[\hspace*{6.5pt}\cSymbol\csp] A \cSymbolName indicates a
\emph{recommendation} for model consistency. If a model does not follow
this rule, it is not considered strictly invalid as far as the PACKAGENAME specification is concerned; however, it indicates
that the model contains a physical or conceptual inconsistency.
(Mnemonic intention behind the choice of symbol: ``This is a cause for
warning.'')
